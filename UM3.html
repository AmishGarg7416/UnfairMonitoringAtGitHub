              <p>As the class slowly began to heal from the wounds of favoritism, Amish noticed another pressing challenge â€“ a language barrier. Some students, particularly those from non-English-speaking backgrounds, found it difficult to keep up with class discussions and activities conducted primarily in English.

                The language barrier made these students feel isolated and unable to fully participate in the learning process. They resorted to speaking in Hindi, their native language, as a means of communication among themselves. However, speaking in Hindi was strictly prohibited at City Montessori Academy, adding to their sense of alienation.
                
                Amish understood the importance of addressing this issue to foster a truly inclusive environment. He firmly believed that language should never be a barrier to learning and building meaningful connections. So, he decided to take the matter to Ms. Delilah, hoping for a positive change.
                
                One afternoon, after the class had ended, Amish approached Ms. Delilah with a proposal. He suggested incorporating bilingual elements in the classroom, allowing students to occasionally use Hindi during discussions, so those struggling with English could feel more included and confident.
                
                Ms. Delilah was initially hesitant, concerned about maintaining the English-only policy. However, Amish's reasoning and genuine concern for his classmates touched her heart. She realized that fostering an inclusive and supportive environment was essential for every student's academic and personal growth.
                
                After much contemplation, Ms. Delilah agreed to Amish's proposal, albeit with certain guidelines to ensure a balanced approach. The class would still predominantly be conducted in English, but Amish's suggestion opened the door to more accommodating and understanding interactions.
                
                Amish's efforts didn't end there. He took it upon himself to sit with students who struggled with English and patiently explain concepts to them in Hindi. His kindness and willingness to help others inspired his peers to follow suit, creating a supportive atmosphere within the class.</p>
