                <p>One of the most significant contributors to the class's disunity was the issue of unfair favoritism displayed by the girl monitor, Shruti. Known for her academic excellence and an inner circle of close friends, Shruti unwittingly perpetuated a division among the students. She often prioritized her friends when it came to assignments and tasks, leaving others feeling excluded and unimportant.

                  Amish couldn't help but notice how this favoritism created a sense of competition and animosity among the students. Those outside Shruti's circle struggled to find their place in the class, leading to feelings of inadequacy and resentment. The once united class now stood divided into cliques, each group vying for Shruti's attention and approval.
                  
                  Unable to witness the growing chasm, Amish decided it was time to address this issue directly. One day after school, he approached Shruti with a sense of determination in his eyes. "Shruti, can we talk?" he asked gently.
                  
                  Surprised by Amish's seriousness, Shruti agreed and they found a quiet corner to have their conversation. Amish carefully chose his words, expressing his concerns about the favoritism that had seeped into the class. He explained how it was causing unnecessary divisions and making some students feel left out.
                  
                  Shruti, initially defensive, soon recognized the truth in Amish's words. She hadn't intended to create rifts among her classmates, but her actions spoke louder than her intentions. The realization weighed heavily on her, and she felt a pang of guilt for not being more mindful of her role as a monitor.
                  
                  "I never meant to hurt anyone," Shruti finally admitted, her voice tinged with remorse. "I guess I was just caught up in my own world and didn't realize the impact of my actions."
                  
                  Amish offered a reassuring smile, understanding that change wasn't instantaneous. "It's never too late to change, Shruti. I believe in you, and I know you can be a fair and just monitor for the entire class."
                  
                  With Amish's empathy and guidance, Shruti resolved to be more mindful of her actions and treat all her classmates fairly. It wasn't an easy journey, as old habits die hard, but Amish was patient, knowing that genuine transformation took time.</p>
